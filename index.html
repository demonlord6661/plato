        <p class="p2">A past time of many i had was to watch anime of any sort avoid the one with a lot of 3D in them unless it was a good anime like overlord then it would be good either way as well as season four coming out was a great thing that came with summer.</p>

        <p class="p2">The sheer amount of Tv i watched and gave my best not to made it imposable for me to find a new show to see any time soon as it was a constant challenge not to die of nothingness but overall it was a fun experience when they re-added the MIB series.</p>

        <p class="p2">When i could i would use this time to get my VIP hours in and have as much fun as u could having completed the game and having been through almost every choice from evil to good and having seen the best of the game and the worst all in one from fighting to PVP and area to the death soccer.</p>

        <p class="p2">This held the least amount of my time on break my total rate of screen time went down by 20% since summer even more during summer because phones weren't allowed out during work so i set mine aside most of summer unless i was really bored i would sink into youtube shorts and not come out till a year later.</p>
